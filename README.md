This project is an interactive website for demonstrating or simulating **signed binary multiplication** via three methods:

-   Pencil-and-paper method
-   Booth's algorithm
-   Extended Booth's algorithm (also known as *modified Booth's algorithm*, *radix-4 Booth's algorithm*, or *bit-pair recoding*)

This website is a major course output in a computer organization and architecture class. The following are its key features:

-   Support for both decimal and binary number input, up to a maximum of 16 bits (minimum: &ndash;2<sup>15</sup> = &ndash;32768, maximum: 2<sup>15</sup> &ndash; 1 = 32767)
-   Option to switch between demonstrating each step one at a time and displaying all the steps at once
-   Playback controls for navigating through the step-by-step demonstration
-   Exporting of step-by-step demonstration to a text file

ðŸ’¡ **UPDATE (12/22/2022): With the shutting down of free Heroku services, we have migrated to Vercel: https://binary-multiply.vercel.app/**

## Running the Simulator

### User Manual

For detailed instructions on how to use this simulator, you may refer to our [user manual](https://github.com/memgonzales/binary-multiplication/blob/master/User%20Manual.pdf). 

### Running on the Web

Open the following website: https://binary-multiply.vercel.app/

### Running Locally

1. Create a copy of this repository:

    - If [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed, type the following command on the terminal:

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/memgonzales/binary-multiplication
        ```

    - If git is not installed, click the green `Code` button near the top right of the repository and choose [`Download ZIP`](https://github.com/memgonzales/binary-multiplication/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Once the zipped folder has been downloaded, extract its contents.

2. Open [`index.html`](https://github.com/memgonzales/binary-multiplication/blob/master/index.html).

    - There is no need to install any additional software or dependency. However, internet connection is required to load fonts, libraries, and toolkits from their respective content delivery networks (CDNs).

_The descriptions of these technologies are taken from their respective websites._

The opinionated code formatter [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) was employed to enforce uniformity and consistency of coding style.

The website was refactored into a PHP application for faster and lightweight deployment on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), a cloud platform as a service (PaaS).

ðŸ’¡ **UPDATE (12/22/2022):** With the shutting down of free Heroku services, we have migrated to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), another cloud PaaS.
