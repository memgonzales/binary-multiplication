# Binary Multiplication
This project is an interactive website for demonstrating or simulating **signed binary multiplication** via three methods:
- **Pencil-and-paper method**
- **Booth's algorithm**
- **Extended Booth's algorithm** (also known as **modified Booth's algorithm**, **radix-4 Booth's algorithm**, or **bit-pair recoding**)

This website is a major course output in a computer organization and architecture class. The following are its key features:
- Support for both **decimal and binary number input**, up to a maximum of 16 bits (minimum: &ndash;2<sup>15</sup> = &ndash;32768, maximum: 2<sup>15</sup> &ndash; 1 = 32767)
- Option to switch between **demonstrating each step one at a time** and **displaying all the steps at once**
- **Playback controls** for navigating through the step-by-step demonstration
- Exporting of step-by-step demonstration to a **text file**

### Running on the Web
Open the following website: [INSERT LINK HERE]

### Running Locally
1. Create a copy of this repository:
   - If [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed, type the following command on the terminal:
   
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/memgonzales/binary-multiplication
     ```
      
   - If git is not installed, click the green <code>Code</code> button near the top right of the repository and choose <code>Download ZIP</code>. Once the zipped folder has been downloaded, extract its contents.
   
2. Open [`home.html`](https://github.com/memgonzales/binary-multiplication/blob/master/home.html). 
   - There is no need to install any additional software or dependency. However, internet connection is required to load fonts, libraries, and toolkits from their respective content delivery networks (CDNs).
